# SpireEngine




SpireEngine is a Vulkan-based, cross-platform mini game engine that uses Slang as its shader compiler.

## Build
SpireEngine currently runs on both Windows and Linux.
### Windows
- Open "GameEngine.sln" in Visual Studio 2019.
- Build the solution. 

The solution file has been setup to automatically download the following dependencies:
- Slang
- Autodesk FBX SDK (for ModelImporter)

### Linux
SpireEngine's Linux build currently does not include ModelImporter. Just run `make` in the project root directory.
```
make -j16
```
The makefile script will automatically check and install Xlib if it does not exist on the system, and download Slang prebuilt binaries to `ExternalLibs/Slang` if they are not already there.

SpireEngine can be built by both `g++` and `clang++`. You can use the `CXX` environment variable to explicitly specify which compiler to use, for example:
```
CXX=clang++ make -j16
```

## Run
To run SpireEngine, you need to download addtional assets. Run the `get_examplegame.ps1` script on Windows, or the `get_examplegame.sh` script on Linux. After the assets have been downloaded, follow these steps to run engine:

### Windows
- In Visual Studio, set GameEngine as start-up project.
- Right click GameEngine project and set the following start-up arguments in Debug settings:
```
-enginedir "$(SolutionDir)EngineContent" -dir "$(SolutionDir)ExampleGame" -level "level0.level"
```
- Run.

### Linux
```
build/linux-x86-64/release/GameEngine -enginedir EngineContent -dir ExampleGame -level "level0.level"
```

## Editor Mode
To run the engine in editor mode, pass `-editor` command line argument when launching GameEngine.

## Render Video Output
SpireEngine supports rendering to video files. You can use the following command line arguments:
- `-reclen <time_in_seconds>`: specifies the length of video output, in seconds.
- `-recdir <mp4_filename_or_directory>`: specifies the location of the ouput video. If a *.mp4 filename is provided, SpireEngine will directly encode the resulting video as an H.264 video file. If a directory name is provided, SpireEngine will output individual images for each frame to the directory.

## Headless Mode
If you need to run SpireEngine in a non-desktop environment, you can pass the `-headless` argument to start without a window. This can be useful when rendering videos on a server through a console interface.
